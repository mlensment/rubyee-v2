  %h2 How to contribute to Rubyest site?
  %p
    All site content is accessible at github's <a href='http://github.com/priit/rubyee'>rubyee repo</a>
    Please clone it and send us merge request.
    We are using very nice <a href='http://staticmatic.rubyforge.org/'>Staticmatic</a>
    generator, so please investigate it a bit before contributing.
    
  %p 
    Rubyest is open for major contributions as well, however we have one simple rule: whatever
    you build, please find time to support your effort in long term, because most of us are 
    already very busy with our day job.
